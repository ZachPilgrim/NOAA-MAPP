Structure should be - 
Main page: Introduction - section from the proposal - team members - brief description, data sources, goal
Scripts page: links? or excerpts of code with a link to download? brief description of what the file is and how to use it?
Data Page: Should work basically like a directory - need to think up how to describe the data and structure it in a logical accesible way
Results page: show some of the results (I'm not sure what these are yet
related works: link to the LTER project

for the main page - top of it should serve as a way to show the most basic information - name of hte project - 1 or 2 sentence description - meet the team - long introduciton - below that should be a simple directory to all the otehr pages

-put in the abstract, other basic descriptions of the project from the proposal
-link to some datasets to show how this could work
-list team members
-show some of the results
-put in a few of the scripts
-list sources and data used
-datasets that we are using? 
maybe some other things that would be helpful
-maybe make a few other pages that link around with each other
-contact flavia about some of this, make sure she is in the loop, and has the chance to say she doesn't have time to work on/help or whatever

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZachPilgrim/Testsite/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
