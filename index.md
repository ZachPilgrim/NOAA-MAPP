You can read more about the project here [in this article](https://franklin.uga.edu/news/stories/2020/uga-led-project-focused-understanding-complexity-droughts).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
