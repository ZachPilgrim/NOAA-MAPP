## Welcome to My github pages example site!

You can read more about the project here [in this article](https://franklin.uga.edu/news/stories/2020/uga-led-project-focused-understanding-complexity-droughts).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ZachPilgrim/Testsite/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
